### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on AI-based security analysis.
- 🌱 I’m a *pythonista*, and currently trying to become a gopher.
- 🍸 I'm interested in making cocktail and scuba diving(just got my [Padi Advanced Open Water Diver](https://www.padi.com/courses/advanced-open-water?lang=en) certificate).
- 🐱 I have two cats named [Ciri](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Ciri) and [Lia](https://mzh.moegirl.org.cn/zh-hans/%E7%88%B1%E8%9C%9C%E8%8E%89%E9%9B%85).
